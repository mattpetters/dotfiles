- [ ] Set up slack integration with the CLI
https://api.slack.com/future/tools/cli
        - would be cool to show number of unreads if possible
        - reply from terminal would be cool (show chat stream, respond)
        - command to quick open app

- [ ] Set up functionality in tmux with `glab` 
        - view open PRs -> `glab mr list` but need to figure out how to show all in group
        - quick open sprint board, merge requests
