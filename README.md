# dotfiles

![Sreenshot of config](https://i.imgur.com/xCnQrmG.png)

1. Clone to home directory

`git clone https://github.com/mattpetters/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`

2. Do this:

```shell
cd ~/.dotfiles
./link.sh
```

~~## Spotify Control~~

~~Includes some aliases for Spotify Control and shorthand env vars for frequent playlists:~~

ie;

```shell
sppt [track name] #play a track
spstop # stop spotify
spp $spotprog #load the programming playlist (env var is the Spotify URI) 

```

I switched to Apple Music, so now the current playing track shows the iTunes song.
